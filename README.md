# CS 320 Portfolio Submission

## Overview
This repository contains my work for CS 320, showcasing my skills in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. The files included demonstrate my ability to create unit tests, analyze software testing approaches, and apply appropriate testing strategies.

## Submitted Files

### **Project One: Contact Service**
- `Contact.java`: Defines the `Contact` class with validation constraints.
- `ContactService.java`: Manages `Contact` objects and their updates.
- `ContactTest.java`: Unit tests for the `Contact` class.
- `ContactServiceTest.java`: Unit tests for the `ContactService` class.

### **Project Two: Summary and Reflections Report**
- `Cs320 Project2 Summary.docx`: A reflection on unit testing techniques, software testing approaches, and best practices.

## Reflection

### **How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
I ensure functionality and security by implementing **unit tests**, **boundary tests**, and **exception handling**. Using **JUnit**, I validate input constraints, handle edge cases, and check system behavior under different conditions. Secure coding practices, such as **input validation** and **avoiding hardcoded data**, help prevent vulnerabilities.

### **How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
I follow a **requirement-driven approach**, analyzing functional specifications before implementation. I ensure that test cases cover **all user requirements**, such as enforcing unique contact IDs and valid phone numbers. **User feedback and test results** guide iterative improvements.

### **How do I approach designing software?**
I use a **modular approach**, ensuring code is **maintainable, scalable, and testable**. I separate concerns by keeping **data models (Contact.java)** and **services (ContactService.java)** independent. Test-driven development (TDD) ensures that features are **validated** before full implementation.
